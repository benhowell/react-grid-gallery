# React Grid Gallery

Justified image gallery component for [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) inspired by [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com/).

## The react-grid-gallery library is no longer maintained

After more than 10 years I've decided it's time to officially end support of the library, today, the 28th of August 2025. As I haven't used it in any project since 2015, the development and maintainence was solely for the benefit of FOSS and my goodwill towards those using this library in their own projects.

Feel free to continue to use, fork, fork and maintain, submit PR's, whatever. Thanks and goodbye!

| enableImageSelection    | bool                      | Optional, default `true`. Allow images to be selectable. Setting this option to `false` whilst supplying images with `isSelected: true` will result in those images being permanently selected.                                              |
| onSelect                | func                      | Optional. Function to execute when an image is selected. Optional args: `index` (index of selected image in images array), `image` (the selected image), `event`. This function is only executable when `enableImageSelection: true`.        |

| onClick                 | func                      | Optional. Function to execute when gallery image clicked. Optional args: `index` (index of selected image in images array), `image` (the clicked image), event (the click event).                                                            |
| tagStyle                | func &#124; CSSProperties | Optional. Style or function that returns style to pass to tag elements. Optional args: `item` (the image item in `images`). Overrides internal tag style.                                                                                    |
| tileViewportStyle       | func &#124; CSSProperties | Optional. Style or function to style the image tile viewport. Optional args: `item` (the image item in `images`). Overrides internal tileViewportStyle function.                                                                             |
| thumbnailStyle          | func &#124; CSSProperties | Optional. Style or function to style the image thumbnail. Optional args: `item` (the image item in `images`). Overrides internal thumbnailStyle function.                                                                                    |
| thumbnailImageComponent | React component           | Optional. Substitute in a React component that would get passed `imageProps` (the props that would have been passed to the `<img>` tag) and `item` (the original item in `images`) to be used to render thumbnails; useful for lazy loading. |
| defaultContainerWidth   | number                    | Optional. Set default width for the container. This option is useful during server-side rendering when we want to generate an initial markup before we can detect the actual container width.                                                |


### General Notes

 * [react-grid-gallery](https://github.com/benhowell/react-grid-gallery) is built for modern browsers and therefore IE support is limited to IE 11 and newer.

 * As the inspiration for this component comes from [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com/), very small thumbnails may not be the most aesthetically pleasing due to the border size applied when selected. A sensible rowHeight default of 180px has been chosen, but rowHeights down to 100px are still reasonable.

 * Gallery width is determined by the containing element. Therefore your containing element must have a width (%, em, px, whatever) **_before_** the gallery is loaded!

 * If you don't know your `width` and `height` values, you can find these out using any number of [javascript hacks](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1944298), bearing in mind the load penalty associated with these methods.
