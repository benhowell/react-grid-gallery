# React Grid Gallery

Justified image gallery component for [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) inspired by [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com/) and based upon [React Images](https://github.com/jossmac/react-images).

### Maintainers wanted:
> As react-grid-gallery continues to gain popularity, I'd like to put out a call for maintainers. If you're interested in maintaining react-grid-gallery, please let me know.

### Note:
> As of the release of  [v0.5.4](https://github.com/benhowell/react-grid-gallery/releases/tag/v0.5.4) (2019-03-10) I will no longer be actively adding features and aggressively maintaining [react-grid-gallery](https://github.com/benhowell/react-grid-gallery). My online behavioral experiment platform [Psychstudio](https://www.psychstudio.com/) consumes all of my time and I am no longer capable of giving react-grid-gallery the attention it needs. A big thanks to [everyone who has contributed](https://github.com/benhowell/react-grid-gallery/blob/master/README.md#acknowledgements) over the last 4 years and thanks to everyone who has downloaded react-grid-gallery (hopefully it has been useful to you). I may apply pull requests and such from time to time.

### General Notes

 * [react-grid-gallery](https://github.com/benhowell/react-grid-gallery) is built for modern browsers and therefore IE support is limited to IE 11 and newer.

 * As the inspiration for this component comes from [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com/), very small thumbnails may not be the most aesthetically pleasing due to the border size applied when selected. A sensible rowHeight default of 180px has been chosen, but rowHeights down to 100px are still reasonable.

 * Gallery width is determined by the containing element. Therefore your containing element must have a width (%, em, px, whatever) **_before_** the gallery is loaded!

 * Image Options: `thumbnail` can point to the same resource as `src`, bearing in mind the resultant data size of the gallery and page load cost. Thumbnails of whatever size will be scaled to match `rowHeight`.


### Programmers Notes

 * User defined functions that allow access to `this` via [Function.prototype.call()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call) do not require you to declare or pass `this` as a parameter. `this` will be defined at the time the function is called.

e.g.
```js
// somewhere in your code...
function myTileViewportStyleFn() {
  if (this.props.item.isSelected)
    return {
           // something stylish...
            };
}

<Gallery images={IMAGES} tileViewportStyle={myTileViewportStyleFn}/>


// internally, within the react-grid-gallery component it will be called like so:
myTileViewportStyleFn.call(this); // this now refers to the image to be styled

```

 * If you don't know your `thumbnailWidth` and `thumbnailHeight` values, you can find these out using any number of [javascript hacks](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1944298), bearing in mind the load penalty associated with these methods.
